This AE does not count towards the Application Exercise grade.\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe data set comes from @zarulli2021, who analyze the effects of a country's healthcare expenditures and other factors on the country's life expectancy. The data are originally from the [Human Development Database](http://hdr.undp.org/en/data) and [World Health Organization](https://apps.who.int/nha/database/).\n\nThis AE will focus on the following variables:\n\n-   `life_exp`: *The average number of years that a newborn could expect to live, if he or she were to pass through life exposed to the sex- and age-specific death rates prevailing at the time of his or her birth, for a specific year, in a given country, territory, or geographic area.* ( from the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/data/gho/indicator-metadata-registry/imr-details/65#:~:text=Definition%3A,%2C%20territory%2C%20or%20geographic%20area.))\n-   `health_pct_gdp`: *Spending on healthcare goods and services, expressed as a percentage of GDP. It excludes capital health expenditures such as buildings, machinery, information technology and stocks of vaccines for emergency or outbreaks.*\n\n[Click here](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253450) for the original research paper and a full list of variables in the original data set.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlife_exp <- read_excel(\"data/life-expectancy-data.xlsx\") |> \n  rename(life_exp = `Life_expectancy_at_birth`, \n         health_pct_gdp = `Domestic_general_government_health_expenditure_pct_of_GDP`)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlife_exp |>\n  select(life_exp, health_pct_gdp) |>\n  glimpse()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRows: 140\nColumns: 2\n$ life_exp       <dbl> 63.8, 78.2, 59.9, 76.2, 74.6, 83.0, 81.3, 72.5, 71.8, 7…\n$ health_pct_gdp <dbl> 5, 41, 44, 74, 16, 68, 73, 20, 18, 61, 84, 66, 21, 74, …\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Exercises\n\nWe begin by visualizing the distributions of life expectancy, health expenditure percentage, and the relationship between these two variables.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np1 <- ggplot(life_exp, aes(x = life_exp)) +\n  geom_histogram() + \n  labs(x = \"Life expectancy\")\n\np2 <- ggplot(life_exp, aes(x = health_pct_gdp)) +\n  geom_histogram() + \n  labs(x = \"% Health expenditure\")\n\np3 <- ggplot(life_exp, aes(x = health_pct_gdp, y = life_exp)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  labs(x = \"% Health expenditure\", \n       y = \"Life expectancy\")\n\n(p1 | p2) / p3\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-02-life-expectancy_files/figure-html/eda-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Exercise 1\n\nDescribe the relationship between life expectancy and healthcare expenditure as a percentage of the GDP. Comment on how we expect the life expectancy to change as the percentage on healthcare expenditure changes.\n\n### Exercise 2\n\nSuppose you want to fit a model so you can use the healthcare expenditure as a percentage of GDP to predict life expectancy. Would a model of the form\n\n$$\\text{life_exp} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 ~ \\text{health_pct_gdp} + \\epsilon$$\n\nbe a useful model for the data? Why or why not?\n",
