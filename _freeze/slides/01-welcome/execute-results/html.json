It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when ***the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or 'predictors')***. More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or 'criterion variable') changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed.\"\n\nSource: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis) (previous definition)\n:::\n\n## Examples of regression in practice\n\n<!--# choose one example, show a visualization and equation, and then show the underlying matrices-->\n\n-   [New Yorkers Will Pay \\$56 A Month To Trim A Minute Off Their Commute](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-yorkers-will-pay-56-a-month-to-trim-a-minute-off-their-commute/)\n\n-   [How FiveThirtyEight's 2020 Presidential Forecast Works --- And What's Different Because Of COVID-19](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fivethirtyeights-2020-presidential-forecast-works-and-whats-different-because-of-covid-19/)\n\n-   [Effect of Forensic Evidence on Criminal Justice Case Processing](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1556-4029.12020)\n\n-   [Why it's so freaking hard to make a good COVID-19 model](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-its-so-freaking-hard-to-make-a-good-covid-19-model/) (from March 2020)\n\n<!--# update these?-->\n\n# STA 221\n\n## What is the course? \n\n<!--# something about being a blend of sta210 + sta 211-->\n\n<!--# maybe show the regression equation + matrix-->\n\n## Course FAQ <!--# udpate this--> {.midi}\n\n**Q - What background is assumed for the course?**\n\nA - Introductory statistics or probability course at Duke\n\n. . .\n\n**Q - Will we be doing computing?**\n\nA - Yes. We will use the computing language R for analysis, Quarto for writing up results, and GitHub for version control and collaboration\n\n. . .\n\n**Q - Will we learn the mathematical theory of regression?**\n\nA - Yes and No. The course is primarily focused on application; however, we will discuss some of the mathematics of simple linear regression. There a 0.5-credit course [STA 211: Mathematics of Regression](https://stat.duke.edu/courses/mathematics-regression) to take simultaneously or after this course to dive into more of the mathematics.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Course learning objectives <!--# update--> {.midi}\n\nBy the end of the semester, you will be able to...\n\n-   analyze real-world data to answer questions about multivariable relationships.\n\n-   use R to fit and evaluate linear and logistic regression models.\n\n-   assess whether a proposed model is appropriate and describe its limitations.\n\n-   use Quarto to write reproducible reports and GitHub for version control and collaboration.\n\n-   effectively communicate statistical results through writing and oral presentations.\n\n## Course topics <!--# update--> {.midi}\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Unit 1: Quantitative Response Variable**\n\n-   Simple Linear Regression\n\n-   Multiple Linear Regression\n\n<br>\n\n**Unit 2: Categorical Response Variable**\n\n-   Logistic Regression\n-   Multinomial logistic regression\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Unit 3: Looking Ahead**\n\n-   Special topics\n\n-   Presenting statistical results\n:::\n:::\n\n# Course overview\n\n## Classroom community \n\n<!--# maybe restructure this-->\n\n::: small\nIt is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit.\n\n-   If you have a name that differs from those that appear in your official Duke records, please let me know.\n\n-   Please let me know your preferred pronouns, if you are comfortable sharing.\n\n-   If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your advisers and deans are excellent resources.\n\n-   I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said or done in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.\n:::\n\n## Accessibility\n\n-   The [Student Disability Access Office (SDAO)](https://access.duke.edu/students) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments.\n\n-   If you have documented accommodations from SDAO, please send the documentation as soon as possible.\n\n-   I am committed to making all course activities and materials accessible.

Complete all the preparation work (readings and videos) before class.\n\n2.  Ask questions.\n\n3.  Do the homework and labs; get started on homework early when possible.\n\n4.  Don't procrastinate and don't let a week pass by with lingering questions.\n\n5.
