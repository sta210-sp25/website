One work strategy is to get through portions that you think will be most challenging (which initially might be the coding component) during lab when a TA can help you on the spot and leave the narrative writing until later.\n\n-   Do not pressure each other to finish early (particularly once you start working on teams); use the time wisely to really learn the material and produce a quality report.\n\n## Workflow and formatting\n\nPart of the lab grade is for \"workflow and formatting\" assessing the reproducible workflow and document format. This includes\n\n-   Having at least 3 informative commit messages (practicing version control)\n    -   There are markers in Lab 01 to help you incorporate version control in your workflow\n-   The PDF is neatly organized document with clear exercise headings and readable code and narrative\n-   The name (first and last) and date are updated at the top of the document.\n\n## **When you're done with lab**\n\n-   Make sure all your final changes have been pushed to your GitHub repo\n-   Submit your final PDF to Gradescope\n    -   Access Gradescope through the course Canvas site\n    -   Mark the pages associated with each exercise.\n\n## Lab 01: Park access\n\nToday's lab focuses on exploratory data analysis and simple linear regression, content from Weeks 01 and 02 in the course.\n\nðŸ”— [sta221-fa24.netlify.app/labs/lab-01.html](https://sta221-fa24.netlify.app/labs/lab-01.html)\n",
