We will continue discussing statistical inference in this week's lectures, so **this lab will be due on Thursday, October 3, 2024.**\n\nðŸ”— [https://sta221-fa24.netlify.app/labs/lab-03](https://sta221-fa24.netlify.app/labs/lab-03In this lab you will use linear regression and statistical inference to draw conclusions about penguins living in Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica. You will also use the data to check conditions about the distribution of the model residuals.  During the lab session, you will also begin developing research questions for your final project.)\n\n## Project\n\n**Goal**: Use the methods from STA 221 to analyze data and answer a research question developed by your team.\n\n**Milestones**: There are periodic project milestones throughout the semester. \\\n\n\\[Add milestones\\]\n\n**Submission**: All work for the project will be submitted in your team's GitHub repo. You will receive feedback via an Issue on GitHub to model a workflow often used in practice.\n\n## Project: Research question\n\nToday's goals: Develop three potential research questions your team may be interested in exploring.\n\nFor each research question: \\[include criteria\\]\n\nThe goal of this milestone is for you to develop research questions to motivate the research. You do [**not**]{.underline} need to have a data set at this point.\n\n## Reminder: Team workflow\n\n-   Only <u>**one**</u> team member should type at a time. There are markers in today's lab to help you determine whose turn it is to type.\n\n    -   Every team member should still be engaged in discussion for all questions, even if it's not your turn type.\n\n-   Don't forget to **pull** to get your teammates' updates before making changes to the `.qmd` file.\n\n    ::: callout-important\n    **Only one submission per team on Gradescope. Read the submission instructions carefully!**\n    :::\n\n## Reminder: Tips for working on a team {.midi}\n\n-   Do not pressure each other to finish early; use the time wisely to really learn the material and produce a quality report.\n\n-   The labs are structured to help you learn the steps of a data analysis. Do not split up the lab among the team members; work on it together in its entirety.\n\n-   Everyone has something to contribute! Use the lab groups as an opportunity to share ideas and learn from each other.\n",
