We will continue discussing statistical inference in this week's lectures, so **this lab will be due on Thursday, October 3, 2024.**\n\nðŸ”— [https://sta221-fa24.netlify.app/labs/lab-03](https://sta221-fa24.netlify.app/labs/lab-03In%20this%20lab%20you%20will%20use%20linear%20regression%20and%20statistical%20inference%20to%20draw%20conclusions%20about%20penguins%20living%20in%20Palmer%20Archipelago%20in%20Antarctica.%20You%20will%20also%20use%20the%20data%20to%20check%20conditions%20about%20the%20distribution%20of%20the%20model%20residuals.%20During%20the%20lab%20session,%20you%20will%20also%20begin%20developing%20research%20questions%20for%20your%20final%20project.)\n\n## Final Team Project {.midi}\n\n**Goal**: Use the methods from STA 221 to analyze data and answer a research question developed by your team\n\n**Primary deliverables:**\n\n1.  an in-person presentation about the exploratory data analysis and initial modeling\n2.  a written, reproducible final report detailing your analysis\n3.  a GitHub repository containing all work from the project\n\n**Submission**: All work for the project will be submitted in your team's GitHub repo. You will receive feedback via an Issue on GitHub to model a workflow often used in practice.\n\n## Final team project {.midi}\n\n**Milestones**: There are periodic project milestones throughout the semester to help you work towards the final deliverables:\n\n-   Research questions (today's lab)\n-   Project proposal (next week's lab)\n-   Exploratory data analysis draft\n-   Presentation + Presentation comments\n-   Analysis draft + peer review\n-   Round 1 submission (optional)\n-   Written report\n-   Reproducibility + organization\n\nSee the [Final Project Instructions](../project.html) for a timeline and details for each milestone.\n\n## Today: Research questions\n\n**Goal:** Develop three potential research questions your team may be interested in investigating.\n\nYou do [**not**]{.underline} need to have a data set at this point\n\nFull instructions here: [sta221-fa24.netlify.app/project#research-questions](https://sta221-fa24.netlify.app/project#research-questions)\n\n## Reminder: Team workflow\n\n-   Only <u>**one**</u> team member should type at a time. There are markers in today's lab to help you determine whose turn it is to type.\n\n    -   Every team member should still be engaged in discussion for all questions, even if it's not your turn type.\n\n-   Don't forget to **pull** to get your teammates' updates before making changes to the `.qmd` file.\n\n    ::: callout-important\n    **Only one submission per team on Gradescope. Read the submission instructions carefully!**\n    :::\n\n## Reminder: Tips for working on a team {.midi}\n\n-   Do not pressure each other to finish early; use the time wisely to really learn the material and produce a quality report.\n\n-   The labs are structured to help you learn the steps of a data analysis. Do not split up the lab among the team members; work on it together in its entirety.\n\n-   Everyone has something to contribute! Use the lab groups as an opportunity to share ideas and learn from each other.\n",
