Click on the repo with the prefix **hw-01**. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.\n\n-   Clone the repo and start a new project in RStudio. See the [Lab 00](https://sta210-sp25.netlify.app/labs/lab-00#getting-started) for details on cloning a repo and starting a new project in R.\n\nThe following packages will be used in this assignment:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#| message: false \n\nlibrary(tidyverse)  # for data wrangling \nlibrary(tidymodels) # for modeling and inference \nlibrary(knitr)      # to neatly format tables \nlibrary(scales)     # to format visualizations \n\n# load other packages as needed \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# Data: US Counties\n\nThe data are from the `county_2019` data frame in the [usdata](https://openintrostat.github.io/usdata/index.html) R package. These data were originally collected in the 2019 [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs) (ACS), an annual survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau that collects demographics and other information from a sample of households in the United States. The data frame `county_2019` contains county-level statistics from the ACS.\n\nThe data for this analysis are available in the file `us-counties-sample.csv` in the `data` folder of your repo. It contains a random sample of 600 counties in the United States. This is about 19% of the counties in the United States.\n\nThis analysis focuses on the following variables:\n\n-   `bachelors`: Percent of population 25 years old and older that earned a Bachelor's degree or higher\n\n-   `median_household_income`: Median household income in US dollars\n\n-   `household_has_computer`: Percent of households that have desktop or laptop computer\n\n[Click here](https://openintrostat.github.io/usdata/reference/county_2019.html) for the full codebook for the `county_2019` data set.\n\n<!--# using the data set from fall 2023. Need to figure out how map_data_sample is created.-->\n\nYou will use two other data sets `county-map-sample.csv` and `county-map-all.csv` to create spatial visualizations of the ACS variables. Use the code below to load all of the data sets.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#| message: false \n#| eval: false \n\ncounty_data_sample <- read_csv(\"data/us-counties-sample.csv\") \nmap_data_sample <-  read_csv(\"data/county-map-sample.csv\") \nmap_data_all <- read_csv(\"data/county-map-all.csv\") \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# Exercises\n\nThere is a lot of public interest in understanding the impact of graduating college, i.e., obtaining a bachelor's degree, on one's future career and lifetime earnings. The common convention is that individuals who have earned a bachelor's degree (or higher) will earn more income over the course of a lifetime than an individual who does not have such a degree.\n\nWe will explore this at a county-level and examine the association between the percent of adults 25 years old + with a Bachelor's degree median household income. Specifically we'd like to answer questions such as, \"do counties that have a higher percentage of college graduates have higher median household incomes, on average, compared to counties with a lower percentage of college graduates?\".\n\n## Instructions\n\nType your responses to each question in your Quarto document. Write all narrative using complete sentences and include informative axis labels and titles on visualizations. Use a reproducible workflow by periodically rendering the Quarto document, writing an informative commit message, and pushing the updated `.qmd` and .`pdf` files to GitHub.\n\n## Part 1: Exploratory data analysis\n\n### Exercise 1\n\nCreate a histogram of the distribution of the predictor variable `bachelors` and calculate appropriate summary statistics. Use the visualization and summary statistics to describe the distribution. Include an informative title and axis labels on the plot.\n\n### Exercise 2\n\nLet's view the data in another way. Use the code below to make a map of the United States with the color of the counties filled in based on the percent of residents 25 years old and older who have a Bachelor's degree. Fill in title and axis labels.\n\nThen use the plot answer the following:\n\n-   What are 2 observations you have from the map?\n\n-   What is a feature that is apparent in the map that wasn't as easily apparent from the histogram in the previous exercise? What is a feature that is apparent in the histogram that is not as easily apparent from the map?\n\n<!--# Need to figure out how to update maps data-->\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#| fig.show: hide \n#| message: false \n\ncounty_map_data <- left_join(county_data_sample, map_data_sample) \n\nggplot(data = map_data_all) + \n  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), \n    fill = \"lightgray\", color = \"white\" \n    ) + \n  geom_polygon(data = county_map_data, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, \n    fill = bachelors) \n    ) + \n  labs( \n    x = \"Longitude\", \n    y = \"Latitude\", \n    fill = \"_____\", \n    title = \"_____\" \n  ) + \n  scale_fill_viridis_c(labels = label_percent(scale = 1)) + \n  coord_quickmap() \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Exercise 3\n\nCreate a visualization of the relationship between `bachelors` and `median_household_income` and calculate the correlation. Use the visualization and correlation to describe the relationship between the two variables.\n\n::: render-commit-push\n\nThis is a good place to render, commit, and push changes to your hw-01 repo on GitHub. Write an informative commit message (e.g. “Completed exercises 1 - 3”), and push every file to GitHub by clicking the check box next to each file in the Git pane. After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.\n\n:::\n\n## Part 2: Modeling\n\n### Exercise 4\n\nWe will use a linear regression model to describe the relationship between `bachelors` and `median_household_income`.\n\nWrite the form of the statistical (theoretical) model we will use for this task using mathematical notation. Use variable names (`bachelors` and `median_household_income`) in the equation for your model[^1].\n\n[^1]: [Click here](https://oeis.org/wiki/List_of_LaTeX_mathematical_symbols) for a guide on writing mathematical symbols using LaTex.\n\n::: callout-tip\n\nWrite median household income in LaTex as\n\n`\\text{median\\_household\\_income}`\n\nto make it properly render in the .pdf document.\n\n:::\n\n### Exercise 5\n\n-   Fit the regression line corresponding to the statistical model in the previous exercise. Neatly display the model output using 3 digits.\n\n-   Write the equation of the fitted model using mathematical notation. Use variable names (`bachelors` and `median_household_income`) in the equation.\n\n### Exercise 6\n\n-   Interpret the slope in the context of the data.\n\n-   Is it useful to interpret the intercept for this data? If so, write the interpretation in the context of the data. Otherwise, briefly explain why not.\n\n::: render-commit-push\n\nThis is a good place to render, commit, and push changes to your hw-01 repo on GitHub. Write an informative commit message (e.g. “Completed exercises 4 -6”), and push every file to GitHub by clicking the check box next to each file in the Git pane. After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.\n\n:::\n\n## Part 3: Inference for the U.S.\n\nWe will use the data from these 600 randomly selected counties to draw conclusions about the relationship between the percent of adults age 25 and older with a bachelor's degree and median household income for the over 3,000 counties in the United States.\n\n### Exercise 7\n\n-   What is the population in this analysis? What is the sample?\n\n-   Is it reasonable to treat the sample in this analysis as representative of the population? Briefly explain why or why not.\n\n### Exercise 8\n\nNext, compute a 98% bootstrap confidence interval for the slope. Use `set.seed(2025)` and 1000 iterations. Show all relevant code and output used to compute the interval.\n\nWrite the 98% confidence interval using 3 digits.\n\n### Exercise 9\n\n-   Interpret the interval from the previous exercise in the context of the data.\n\n-   Suppose you wanted to evaluate the claim that there is no linear relationship between the percent of adults age 25 and older with a bachelor's degree and median household income for counties in the United States. In other words, you want to evaluate the claim that $\\beta_1 = 0$ in the model written in Exercise 4.\n\n    Does the confidence interval from the previous exercise support this claim? Briefly explain why or why not.\n\n::: render-commit-push\n\nNow is a good time to render your document again if you haven't done so recently, commit (with an informative commit message), and push all updates.\n\n:::\n\n# Submission\n\n::: callout-warning\n\nBefore you wrap up the assignment, make sure all documents are updated on your GitHub repo. We will be checking these to make sure you have been practicing how to commit and push changes.\n\nRemember – you must turn in a PDF file to the Gradescope page before the submission deadline for full credit.\n\n:::\n\nTo submit your assignment:\n\n-   Access Gradescope through the [STA 210 Canvas site](https://canvas.duke.edu/courses/47067).\n\n-   Click on the assignment, and you’ll be prompted to submit it.\n\n-   Mark the pages associated with each exercise. All of the pages of your lab should be associated with at least one question (i.e., should be “checked”).\n\n-   Select the first page of your .PDF submission to be associated with the *“Workflow & formatting”* section.\n\n# Grading (50 points)\n\n| Component             | Points |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Ex 1                  | 5      |\n| Ex 2                  | 5      |\n| Ex 3                  | 5      |\n| Ex 4                  | 5      |\n| Ex 5                  | 5      |\n| Ex 6                  | 5      |\n| Ex 7                  | 5      |\n| Ex 8                  | 5      |\n| Ex 9                  | 5      |\n| Workflow & formatting | 5      |\n\nThe “Workflow & formatting” grade is to assess the reproducible workflow and document format for the applied exercises. This includes having at least 3 informative commit messages, a neatly organized document with readable code and your name and the date updated in the YAML.\n",
