In particular, we will consider the problem of distinguishing between two different rice varieties, *Cammeo* and *Osmancik*, based on pictures of the grains. The data is available on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/545/rice+cammeo+and+osmancik).\n\n<!--# add the paper -->\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrice <- read_csv(\"data/rice.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nOur outcome variable will be `Class` (the type of rice), and we will be used two predictors, namely `Area` and `Eccentricity`. `Area` refers to the size of the rice grain as measured in pixels, and `Eccentricity` measures how close to a circle the rice shape is (0 would be a perfect circle).\n\n## Exercises\n\n### Exercise 1\n\nLet us begin by visualizing the data. Create a scatterplot of `Area` against `Eccentricity`, and color the points by the assigned class.\n\n### Exercise 2\n\nComment on the above plot. Does it look like the two types of rice can be separated based on the two chosen features?\n\n### Exercise 3\n\nWith this type of classification problems, it is common to test the performance of a logistic regression by splitting the data into a *training* and a *test* set. This means that we will choose a random subset of the data to estimate the regression coefficient, and we will then test the predictions on the remaining observations.\n\nRandomly select 75% of the rows of the data to create a dataset `rice_train`, and place the remaining 25% in a dataset named `rice_test`.\n\n### Exercise 5\n\nIn a logistic regression model, it is commonly said that the *log-odds* of the outcome being 1 is given by $$\\log\\Big(\\frac{\\pi_i}{1-\\pi_i}\\Big) = \\mathbf{x}_i^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\beta}$$ What does each $\\pi_i$ represent? How are the log-odds related to the probability of the outcome variable being 1? Make sure to show the mathematical relationship between the two quantities.\n\n### Exercise 6\n\nEstimate the logistic regression model for `Class` on the chosen predictors using the `rice_train` data. Display the regression output and interpret the coefficients. Does the intercept have any reasonable interpretation? If so, interpret the intercept. Otherwise explain why not.\n\n### Exercise 7\n\nInterpret the coefficients on `Area` and `Eccentricity`, and comment on their significance.\n\n### Exercise 8\n\nHow would you expect the log-odds of the rice grain being of the Osmancik variety to change if the measures eccentricity changes from 0.85 to 0.9? How does that translate into the estimated probabilities?\n\n### Exercise 9\n\nLet us now test our model on the test set. Using the `predict` function, obtain the predicted probabilities of the rice type being Osmancik for the observations in `rice_test`.\n\n### Exercise 10\n\nWith these estimated probabilities, we can now try to classify the rice in the test set. Choose a way to assign a label to each observation based on the estimated probability, and describe it here. Compare the estimated class assignments you constructed with the actual classes.
