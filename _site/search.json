That is your final project.\nThe goal of the final project is for you to use regression analysis to analyze a data set of your own choosing. The data set may already exist or you may collect your own data by scraping the web.\nChoose the data based on your group’s interests or work you all have done in other courses or research projects. The goal of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class (and beyond, if you like!) and apply them to a data set to analyze it in a meaningful way.\nAll analyses must be done in RStudio using Quarto and GitHub, and your analysis and written report must be reproducible.\n\nLogistics\nYou will work on the project with your lab groups. The four primary deliverables for the final project are\n\na written, reproducible report detailing your analysis\na GitHub repository corresponding to your report\nslides and an in-person presentation\nformal peer review on another team’s work and presentation feedback"

If you’re unsure where to find data, you can use the list of potential data sources on the Tips + resources page as a starting point. It may also help to think of topics you’re interested in investigating and find data sets on those topics.\nThe data set must meet the following criteria:\n\nAt least 500 observations\nAt least 10 columns, such that at least 6 of the columns are useful and unique predictor variables.\n\ne.g., identifier variables such as “name”, “ID number”, etc. are not useful predictor variables.\ne.g., if you have multiple columns with the same information (e.g. “state abbreviation” and “state name”), then they are not unique predictors.\n\nAt least one variable that can be identified as a reasonable response variable.\n\nThe response variable can be quantitative or categorical.\n\nA mix of quantitative and categorical variables that can be used as predictors.\nMay not be data that has previously been used in any course materials, or any derivation of data that has been used in course materials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of data sets to avoid\n\n\n\n\nData that are likely violate the independence condition. Therefore, avoid data with repeated measures, data collected over time, etc.\nData sets in which there is no information about how the data were originally collected\nData sets in which there are missing or unclear definitions about the observations and/or variables\n\n\n\nAsk a member of the teaching team if you’re unsure whether your data set meets the criteria.\nThe proposal will include the following sections:\n\nSection 1: Introduction\nThe introduction section includes\n\nan introduction to the subject matter you’re investigating (citing any relevant literature)\nthe motivation for your research question (citing any relevant literature)\nthe primary research question you are interested in exploring\nyour team’s hypotheses regarding the research question\n\nThis is a narrative about what you think regarding the research question, not formal statistical hypotheses.\n\n\n\n\nSection 2: Data description\nThe data description section includes\n\nthe source of the data set\na description of when and how the data were originally collected (by the original data curator, not necessarily how you found the data)\na description of the observations and general characteristics being measured\n\n\n\nSection 3: Initial exploratory data analysis\nIn this section, you will begin to explore the data. This includes using narrative, visualizations and summary statistics to describe the following:\n\ndistribution of the response variable\ndistributions of one potential quantitative predictor variable and one potential categorical predictor variable\nthe relationships between the response variable and each of the predictors from the previous step\na potential interaction effect you’re interested in exploring (it doesn’t have to be an interaction with the two predictors from above)\n\nThese steps are to help get you started on exploratory data analysis and will not be the complete EDA for the final report. The requirements above are minimum requirements, but your group is welcome to include more at this stage.\nIn this section, you will also describe any data cleaning you need to do to prepare for modeling, such as imputing missing values, collapsing levels for categorical predictors, creating new variables, summarizing data, etc.\n\n\nSection 4: Analysis approach\nIn this section, you will provide a brief overview of your analysis approach. This includes\n\na description of the response variable and list of all potential predictors\nregression model technique (multiple linear regression or logistic regression)\n\n\n\nData dictionary (aka code book)\nSubmit a data dictionary for all the variables in your data set in the README of the data folder. You do not need to include the data dictionary in the PDF document.\n\n\nSubmission\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWrite your narrative and analysis for Sections 1 - 4 in the proposal.qmd file. Put the data set and the data dictionary in the data folder.\nSubmit the PDF of the proposal to Gradescope. Mark all pages of the document.\n\n\n\n\nGrading\nThe anticipated length, including all graphs, tables, narrative, etc., is 2 -4 pages; it may not exceed 5 pages.\nThe proposal is worth 15 points and will be graded based on accurately and comprehensively addressing the criteria stated above. Points will be assigned based on a holistic review of the project proposal.\n\nExcellent (14 - 15 points) : All required elements are completed and are accurate. There is a thorough exploration of the data as descrbied above, and the team has demonstrated a careful and thoughtful approach exploring the data and preparing it for analysis. The narrative is written clearly, all tables and visualizations are nicely formatted, and the work would be presentable in a professional setting.\nStrong: (11 - 13 points): Requirements are mostly met, but there are some elements that are incomplete or inaccurate. Some minor revision of the work required before team is ready for modeling.\nSatisfactory (8 - 10 points): Requirements partially met, but there are some elements that are incomplete and/or inaccurate. Major revision of the work required before team is ready for modeling.\nNeeds Improvement (7 or fewer points points): Requirements are largely unmet, and there are large elements that are incomplete and/or inaccurate. Substantial revisions of the work required before team is ready for modeling."

Therefore, the draft and peer review will focus primarily on the exploratory data analysis, modeling, and initial interpretations.\n\nDraft report\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue dates\n\n\n\nDraft is due in your project GitHub repo at 9am on\n\nTuesday, November 14 (Tuesday labs)\nThursday, November 16 (Thursday labs)\n\n\n\nWrite the draft in the written-report.qmd file in your project repo. You do not need to submit the draft on Gradescope.\nBelow is a brief description of the sections to focus on in the draft:\n\nIntroduction and data\nThis section includes an introduction to the project motivation, data, and research question. Describe the data and definitions of key variables. It should also include some exploratory data analysis. All of the EDA won’t fit in the body of the report, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.\n\n\nMethodology\nThis section includes a brief description of your modeling process. Explain the reasoning for the type of model you’re fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, any variable transformations (if needed), and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\n\n\nResults\nIn this section, you will output the final model and include a brief discussion of the model assumptions, diagnostics, and any relevant model fit statistics.\nThis section also includes initial interpretations and conclusions drawn from the model.\n\n\nGrading\nThe draft will be graded based on whether there is demonstration of a reasonable attempt at each of the sections described below in the written-report.qmd file in our GitHub repo by the deadline.\n\n\n\nPeer review\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nPeer review comments are due in GitHub at 11:59pm on\n\nWednesday, November 15 (Tuesday labs)\nFriday, November 17 (Thursday labs)\n\n\n\nCritically reviewing others’ work is a crucial part of the scientific process, and STA 210 is no exception. Each lab team will be assigned two other teams’s projects to review. Each team should push their draft to their GitHub repo by the 9am on the day their lab’s draft is due. The lab that week will be dedicate to the peer review, so your team will have time to review and provide quality feedback to two other teams.\nDuring the peer review process, you will be provided read-only access to your partner teams’ GitHub repos. Provide your review in the form of GitHub issues to your partner team’s GitHub repo using the issue template provided in the repo.\n\nSteps for peer review\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeer review assignments\n\n\n\nClick here to see which project your team is reviewing. You’ll spend about 30 minutes reviewing each project.\n\n\nWhen you get to lab, you should have access to the GitHub repos for the teams you’re reviewing. In GitHub, search the repositories for project, and you should see the repos for the projects you’re reviewing. You will be able to read the files in the repo and post issues, but you cannot push changes to the repo. You will have access to the repo until the deadline for the peer review.\nFor each team you’re reviewing:\n\nOpen that team’s repo, read the project draft, and browse the rest of the repo.\nGo to the Issues tab in that repo, click on New issue, and click on Get started for the Peer Review issue. Fill out this issue. You will answer the the following questions:\n\nDescribe the goal of the project.\nDescribe the data set used in the project. What are the observations in the data? What is the source of the data? How were the data originally collected?\nConsider the exploratory data analysis (EDA). Describe one aspect of the EDA that is effective in helping you understand the data. Provide constructive feedback on how the team might improve the EDA.\nDescribe the statistical methods and analysis approach used.\nProvide constructive feedback on how the team might improve their analysis. Make sure your feedback includes at least one comment on the statistical modeling aspect of the project, but also feel free to comment on aspects beyond the modeling.\nWhat aspect of this project are you most interested in and would like to see highlighted in the presentation?\nProvide constructive feedback on any issues with file and/or code organization.\n(Optional) Any further comments or feedback?\n\n\n\n\nGrading\nThe peer review will be graded on the extent to which it comprehensively and constructively addresses the components of the partner team’s report: the research context and motivation, exploratory data analysis, modeling, interpretations, and conclusions."

The mandatory components of the report are below. You are free to add additional sections as necessary. The report, including tables and visualizations, must be no more than 10 pages long. There is no minimum page requirement; however, you should comprehensively address all of the analysis and report.\nBe selective in what you include in your final write-up. The goal is to write a cohesive narrative that demonstrates a thorough and comprehensive analysis rather than explain every step of the analysis.\nYou are welcome to include an appendix with additional work at the end of the written report document; however, grading will overwhelmingly be based on the content in the main body of the report. You should assume the reader will not see the material in the appendix unless prompted to view it in the main body of the report. The appendix should be neatly formatted and easy for the reader to navigate. It is not included in the 10-page limit.\n\nIntroduction and data\nThis section includes an introduction to the project motivation, data, and research question. Describe the data and definitions of key variables. It should also include some exploratory data analysis. All of the EDA won’t fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe research question and motivation are clearly stated in the introduction, including citations for the data source and any external research. The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables. It incorporates appropriate visualizations and summary statistics.\n\n\n\nMethodology\nThis section includes a brief description of your modeling process. Explain the reasoning for the type of model you’re fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to select the variables in the final model; the approach is clearly described in the report. The model selection process took into account potential interaction effects and addressed any violations in model conditions. If violations of model conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.\n\n\n\nResults\nThis is where you will output the final model with any relevant model fit statistics, conditions, and diagnostics.\nDescribe the key results from the model. The goal is not to interpret every single variable in the model but rather to show that you are proficient in using the model output to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe model fit is clearly assessed, and interesting findings from the model are clearly described. The model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed for their model. Interpretations of model coefficients are used to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing the interpretation of every model coefficient. If the primary modeling objective is prediction, the model’s predictive power is thoroughly assessed.\n\n\n\nDiscussion + Conclusion\nIn this section you’ll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved. Any potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here. Lastly, this section will include ideas for future work.\n\nGrading criteria\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the model results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.\n\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted and labeled. All citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. All code, warnings, and messages are suppressed. The main body of the written report (not including the appendix) is no longer than 10 pages.\n\n\nSubmission\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe written report is due on Wednesday, December 13 at 11:59pm.\nTo submit your report, written-report.qmd and the rendered written-report.pdf to your team’s GitHub repo by the deadline.

Use the code chunk header {r set-up, include = FALSE} to suppress this set up code.\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE,\n                      warning = FALSE, \n                      message = FALSE)\n\nAn alternative approach is to add the following code to the YAML:\n\nexecute:\n  echo: false\n  warning: false\n  message: false\n\n\n\n\nHeaders\n\nUse headers to clearly label each section. Make sure there is a space between the last # and the title, so the header renders correctly. For example, ###Section Title will not render as header, but ### Section Title will.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nInclude all references in a section called “References” at the end of the report.\nThis course does not have specific requirements for formatting citations and references.\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\nIf you have additional work that does not fit or does not belong in the body of the report, you may put it at the end of the document in section called “Appendix”.\nThe items in the appendix should be properly labeled.\nThe appendix should only be for additional material. The reader should be able to fully understand your report without viewing content in the appendix.\n\n\n\nResize figures\n\nResize plots and figures, so you have more space for the narrative.\n\nResize individual figures: Use the code chunk header {r plot1, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5}, replacing plot1 with a meaningful label and the height and width with values appropriate for your write up.\nResize all figures: Include the fig_width and fig_height options in your YAML header as shown below:\n\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"Your title\"\nauthor: \"Your names\"\nformat:\n  pdf:\n    fig-width: 7\n    fig-height: 5\n---\nReplace the height and width values with values appropriate for your write up.\n\n\nArranging plots\nArrange plots in a grid, instead of one after the other. This is especially useful when displaying plots for exploratory data analysis and to check assumptions.\n\nIf you’re using ggplot2 functions, the patchwork package makes it easy to arrange plots in a grid. See the documentation and examples here.\nIf you’re using base R function, i.e. when using the emplogit functions, put the code par(mfrow = c(rows,columns)) before the code to make the plots. For example, par(mfrow = c(2,3)) will arrange plots in a grid with 2 rows and 3 columns.\n\n\n\nPlot titles and axis labels\nBe sure all plot titles and axis labels are visible and easy to read.\n\nUse informative titles, not variable names, for titles and axis labels.\nUse coord_flip() to flip the x and y axes on the plot. This is useful if you a bar plot with an x-axis that is difficult to read due to overlapping text.\n\n❌ NO! The x-axis is hard to read because the names overlap.\n\nggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = manufacturer)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n✅ YES! Names are readable\n\nggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = manufacturer)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo a little more to make the plot look professional!\n\nInformative title and axis labels\nFlipped coordinates to make names readable\nArranged bars based on count\nCapitalized manufacturer names\nOptional: Added color - Use a coordinated color scheme throughout paper / presentation\nOptional: Applied a theme - Use same theme throughout paper / presentation\n\n\nmpg |&gt;\n  count(manufacturer) |&gt;\n  mutate(manufacturer = str_to_title(manufacturer)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(manufacturer,n), y = n)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(x = \"Manufacturer\", \n       y = \"Count\", \n       title = \"The most common manufacturer is Dodge\") +\n  theme_bw() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTables and model output\n\nUse the kable function from the knitr package to neatly output all tables and model output. This will also ensure all model coefficients are displayed.\n\nUse the digits argument to display only 3 or 4 significant digits.\nUse the caption argument to add captions to your table.\n\n\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)\ntidy(model) |&gt;\n  kable(digits = 3)\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n30.099\n1.634\n18.421\n0\n\n\nhp\n-0.068\n0.010\n-6.742\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuidelines for communicating results\n\nDon’t use variable names in your narrative! Use descriptive terms, so the reader understands your narrative without relying on the data dictionary.\n\n❌ There is a negative linear relationship between mpg and hp.\n✅ There is a negative linear relationship between a car’s fuel economy (in miles per gallon) and its horsepower.\n\nKnow your audience: Your report should be written for a general audience who has an understanding of statistics at the level of STA 210.\nAvoid subject matter jargon: Don’t assume the audience knows all of the specific terminology related to your subject area. If you must use jargon, include a brief definition the first time you introduce a term.\nTell the “so what”: Your report and presentation should be more than a list of interpretations and technical definitions. Focus on what the results mean, i.e. what you want the audience to know about your topic after reading your report or viewing your presentation.\n\n❌ For every one unit increase in horsepower, we expect the miles per gallon to decrease by 0.068 units, on average.\n✅ If the priority is to have good fuel economy, then one should choose a car with lower horsepower. Based on our model, the fuel economy is expected to decrease, on average, by 0.68 miles per gallon for every 10 additional horsepower.\n\nTell a story: All visualizations, tables, model output, and narrative should tell a cohesive story!\nUse one voice: Though multiple people are writing the report, it should read as if it’s from a single author. At least one team member should read through the report before submission to ensure it reads like a cohesive document.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional resources\n\nExploring RStudio’s Visual Markdown Editor\nR for Data Science\nQuarto documentation:\n\nQuarto PDF Basics\nPresentations in Quarto\n\nData visualization\n\nggplot2 Reference\nggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis\nData Visualization: A Practice Introduction\nPatchwork R Package",

Generate one now?” Click 1 for yes.\nStep 3: You will generate a key. It will begin with “ssh-rsa….” R will then ask “Would you like to open a browser now?” Click 1 for yes.\nStep 4: You may be asked to provide your username and password to log into GitHub. This would be the ones associated with your account that you set up. After entering this information, paste the key in and give it a name. You might name it in a way that indicates where the key will be used, e.g., sta221)\n\n\n\nConfigure git\nThe last thing we need to do is configure your git so that RStudio can communicate with GitHub. This requires two pieces of information: your name and email address.\nTo do so, you will use the use_git_config() function from the usethis package.\nType the following lines of code in the console in RStudio filling in your name and the email address associated with your GitHub account.\n\nusethis::use_git_config(\n  user.name = \"Your name\", \n  user.email = \"Email associated with your GitHub account\"\")\n\nFor example, mine would be\n\nusethis::use_git_config(\n  user.name = \"Maria Tackett\",\n  user.email = \"maria.tackett@duke.edu\")\n\nIt may look like nothing happened but you are now ready interact between GitHub and RStudio!

Students will develop computing skills to implement a reproducible data analysis workflow and gain experience communicating statistical results. Throughout the semester, students will work on a team project where they will develop a research question, answer it using methods learned in the course, and share results through a written report and presentation.\nTopics include applications of linear and logistic regression, analysis of variance, model diagnostics, and model selection. Regression parameter estimation via maximum likelihood least squares will also be discussed. Students will gain experience using the computing tools R and GitHub to analyze real-world data from a variety of fields.\n\n\nEither any STA 100-level course or STA 230, 231, or 240L and MATH 216, 218, or 221.

As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TAs, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you’re not sure about the homework, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.\nDo the readings and other preparation work.\nDo the homework and lab.The earlier you start, the better. It’s not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example.)\nDon’t procrastinate. The content builds upon what was taught in previous weeks, so if something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, etc. Don’t let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, come to office hours and work with a member of the teaching team to help you identify a good (re)starting point.",

My role as instructor is to introduce you to new methods, tools, and techniques, but it is up to you to take them and make use of them. A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities during the lectures and labs. You are expected to prepare for class by completing assigned readings, attend all lecture and lab sessions, and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussion. Additionally, some lectures will feature application exercises that will be graded based on completing what we do in class.\nYou are expected to bring a laptop, tablet, or any device with internet and a keyboard to each class so that you can participate in the in-class exercises. Please make sure your device is fully charged before you come to class, as the number of outlets in the classroom will not be sufficient to accommodate everyone.\n\n\nTeams\nYou will be assigned to a team at the beginning of the semester. You are encouraged to sit with your teammates in lecture and you will also work with them in the lab sessions. All team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of the group activities, labs and the final project. You will be asked to complete teamwork evaluations and self-reflections throughout the semester. Failure to adequately contribute to an assignment can result in a penalty to your score relative to the team’s overall mark.\nYou are expected to make use of the provided GitHub repository as the central collaborative platform.

Most lab assignments will be completed in teams, and all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment. You are expected to use the team’s Git repository in the course’s GitHub organization as the central platform for collaboration. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team member’s relative contribution for each lab, and there will be periodic peer evaluation on the team collaboration. Lab assignments will be completed using Quarto, correspond to an appropriate GitHub repository, and submitted for grading in Gradescope.\nThe lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nHomework\nIn homework, you will apply what you’ve learned during lecture and lab to complete data analysis tasks and explain the underlying mathematics. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Similar to lab assignments, homework must be typed up using Quarto and GitHub and submitted as a PDF in Gradescope.\nOne homework assignment will be dedicated to a statistics experience. The statistics experience is an opportunity to engage with statistics and data science outside of the classroom through podcasts, books, seminars, data analysis competitions, and other activities. As you complete these experiences, the goal is to consider how the material you’re learning in the course connects with society more broadly.\nThe lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be two exams in this course. Each exam will include a closed-notes in-class component and an open-note take-home component. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course thus far. The exams will focus on both conceptual understanding of the applied and mathematical content and application through analysis and computational tasks. The exams will be based on content in reading assignments, lectures, application exercises, homework, and lab assignments. More detail about the exams will be given during the semester.\n\n\nProject\nThe purpose of the final project is to apply what you’ve learned to analyze an interesting data-driven research question. The project will be completed with your lab teams, and each team will present their work through a written report and presentation. More information about the project will be provided during the semester. You can learn more on the final project page.\n\n\nParticipation (Application exercises + teamwork)\n\nApplication exercises\nYou will get the most out of the course if you actively participate in class and when working with your team. Parts of some lectures will be dedicated to working on Application Exercises (AEs). AEs are submitted by pushing your work to the relevant GitHub repo. AEs from Tuesday lectures should be submitted by Friday by 11:59p ET, and AEs from Thursday lectures are should be submitted by Sunday at 11:59p ET. Because AEs are intended for in-class activities, there are no extensions given on AEs.\nAEs will be graded based on making a good-faith effort to attempt all questions covered in class. You are welcome to, but not required, to work on AEs beyond lecture.\nSuccessful on-time effort on at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade.\n\n\nTeamwork\nGiven the collaborative nature of statistics and data science work, teamwork will be a key part of this course. You will work in teams for in-class activities, lab assignments, and the final course project. There will be periodic peer and self-evaluations to reflect on the team’s collaboration. These evaluations will be counted as part of the participation grade.",

    "text": "Course policies\n\nDuke Community Standard\nAll students must adhere to the Duke Community Standard(DCS): Duke University is a community dedicated to scholarship, leadership, and service and to the principles of honesty, fairness, and accountability. Citizens of this community commit to reflect upon these principles in all academic and non-academic endeavors, and to protect and promote a culture of integrity.\nTo uphold the Duke Community Standard, students agree:\n\n\nI will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;\nI will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors;and\nI will act if the Standard is compromised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\n\nThe homework assignments must be completed individually and you are welcomed to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what’s the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share answers to homework questions (including any code) with anyone other than myself and the teaching assistants.\nYou may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams. Unauthorized collaboration or using unauthorized materials will be considered a violation for all students involved. More details will be given closer to the exam date.\nFor the projects and team labs, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project or team labs across teams.\nReusing code: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\nUse of artificial intelligence (AI): You should treat AI tools, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources. There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:2 (1) Cognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning. (2) Ethical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\nAI tools for code: You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. You may use these guidelines for citing AI-generated content.\nNo AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, AI is not permitted for writing narrative on assignments. In general, you may use AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.\n\n\nIf you are unsure if the use of a particular resource complies with the academic honesty policy, please ask a member of the teaching team.\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all Duke policies, including academic integrity (e.g., completing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, adhering to guidance around group work projects,and more).Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. Any questions and/or concerns regarding academic integrity can be directed to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards at conduct@duke.edu.\n\n\nLate work policy\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback in a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest homework and lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\nHomework and labs may be submitted up to 2 days late. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.\nThe late work policy for exams will be provided with the exam instructions.\nThe late work policy for the project will be provided with the project instructions.\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab or homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email me at maria.tackett@duke.edu before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\nIf there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource. Please let me know if you need help contacting your academic dean.\n\n\nRegrade Requests\nRegrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the final project presentations.\n\n\nAttendance policy\nEvery student is expected to attend and participate in lecture and labs. There may be times, however, when you cannot attend class. Lecture recordings are available upon request for students who have an excused absence. See the Lecture recording request policy for more detail. If you miss a lecture, make sure to review the material and complete the application exercise, if applicable, before the next lecture.
