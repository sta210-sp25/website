## Data

Which variables help us predict the amount customers tip at a restaurant? To answer this question, we will use data collected in 2011 by a student at St. Olaf who worked at a local restaurant.

The variables weâ€™ll focus on for this analysis are

-   `Tip`: amount of the tip

-   `Party`: number of people in the party

-   `Meal`: Time of day (Lunch, Dinner, Late Night)

-   `Age`: Age category of person paying the bill (Yadult, Middle, SenCit)

-   `Day`: Day of the week (includes every day but Monday)

View the data set to see the remaining variables.

tips <- read_csv("data/tip-data.csv")
```

## Exercise 1

Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. Use seed `2025`.

```{r}
#| label: ex-1

# add code here
```

## Exercise 2

Use the training data to fit a model using `Party`, `Age`, and `Meal` to predict tips. Compute the $R^2$ and $Adj. R^2$ for this model.

```{r}
#| label: ex-2

# add code here

```

## Exercise 3

Now fit a model predicting tips using `Party`, `Age`, and `Meal`, such that the effect of party can differ by `Meal`. Compute $R^2$ and $Adj. R^2$ for this model.

```{r}
#| label: ex-3

# add code here
```

## Exercise 4

-   Which model do you choose - the model from Exercise 2 or Exercise 3? Why?

-   Compute RMSE for the selected model.

```{r}
#| label: ex-4

# add code here

```

## Exercise 5

Now let's use the testing data to assess the performance of the model selected in Exercise 4.

-   Compute the predicted tips for the testing data. Add the predictions to the testing data set.

-   Compute RMSE and $R^2$ for the testing data.

```{r}
#| label: ex-5

# add code here

```

## Exercise 6

-   How do RMSE compare between the training and testing data?

-   How does $R^2$ compare between the training and testing data?

-   Is this what you expect? Why?

## Exercise 7

Why can we use $R^2$ as an assessment of performance on the testing data even if we can't use it to compare models?
