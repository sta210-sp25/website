## Response to Leukemia treatment

Today's data is from a study where 51 untreated adult patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia who were given a course of treatment, and they were assessed as to their response to the treatment.[^1]

[^1]: The data set is from the Stat2Data R package. This AE is adapted from exercises in *Stat 2.*

The goal of today's analysis is to use pre-treatment factors to predict how likely it is a patient will respond to the treatment.

We will use the following variables:

-   `Age`: Age at diagnosis (in years)
-   `Smear`: Differential percentage of blasts
-   `Infil`: Percentage of absolute marrow leukemia infiltrate
-   `Index`: Percentage labeling index of the bone marrow leukemia cells
-   `Blasts`: Absolute number of blasts, in thousands
-   `Temp`: Highest temperature of the patient prior to treatment, in degrees Fahrenheit
-   `Resp`: 1 = responded to treatment or 0 = failed to respond

```{r}
#| eval: false
leukemia <- read_csv("data/leukemia.csv") |>
  mutate(Resp = factor(Resp))
```

## Comparing models

1.  Consider a model with all the pre-treatment variables: `Age`, `Smear`, `Infil`, `Index`, `Blasts` and `Temp`. Fit a model using these six variables to predict whether a patient responded to the treatment. Call the model `full_model`. Display the model.

```{r}
#| label: full-model 

# add code
```

2.  Based on the model, which pre-treatment variables are statistically significant using a threshold of $\alpha = 0.05$? (We will talk more about inference for logistic regression coefficients in an upcoming lecture.)

3.  Fit a model that only includes the statistically significant predictors. Call the model `reduced_model`.

```{r}
#| label: reduced-model

# add code
```

4.  Use a drop-in-deviance test to compare a model that includes only the significant predictors to the full model. Which model do you choose based on the results of this test?

```{r}
#| label: drop-in-dev-test

# add code
```

5.  Is your choice based on AIC consistent with your choice from the previous exercise? What about a choice based on BIC?

```{r}
#| label: aic-bic

# add code
```
