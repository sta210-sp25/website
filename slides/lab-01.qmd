## Getting started

Ask your TA if

-   You do not have a `lab-01` repo in the GitHub course organization: [github.com/sta221-fa24](https://github.com/sta221-fa24)

-   You need help cloning the repo and starting a new RStudio project

## Tips for working on lab

-   You do not have to finish the lab in class, they will always be due **Thursdays at 11:59pm**. One work strategy is to get through portions that you think will be most challenging (which initially might be the coding component) during lab when a TA can help you on the spot and leave the narrative writing until later.

-   Do not pressure each other to finish early (particularly once you start working on teams); use the time wisely to really learn the material and produce a quality report.

## Workflow and formatting

Part of the lab grade is for "workflow and formatting" assessing the reproducible workflow and document format. This includes

-   Having at least 3 informative commit messages (practicing version control)
    -   There are markers in Lab 01 to help you incorporate version control in your workflow
-   The PDF is neatly organized document with clear exercise headings and readable code and narrative
-   The name (first and last) and date are updated at the top of the document.

## **When you're done with lab**

-   Make sure all your final changes have been pushed to your GitHub repo
-   Submit your final PDF to Gradescope
    -   Access Gradescope through the course Canvas site
    -   Mark the pages associated with each exercise.

## Lab 01: Park access

Today's lab focuses on exploratory data analysis and simple linear regression, content from Weeks 01 and 02 in the course.
