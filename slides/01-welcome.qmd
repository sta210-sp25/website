## What is regression analysis?

<div>

> *Regression analysis is a statistical method used to **examine the relationship between a response variable and one or more predictor variables.** It is used for predicting future values, understanding relationships between variables, and identifying key predictors. It also helps in modeling trends, assessing the impact of changes, and detecting outliers in data.*

## Classroom community

::: small
It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit.

-   If you have a name that differs from those that appear in your official Duke records, please let me know.

-   Please let me know your preferred pronouns, if you are comfortable sharing.

-   If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your advisers and deans are excellent resources.

-   I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said or done in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.
:::

## Accessibility

-   The [Student Disability Access Office (SDAO)](https://access.duke.edu/students) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments.

-   If you have documented accommodations from SDAO, please send the documentation as soon as possible.

-   I am committed to making all course activities and materials accessible. If any course component is not accessible to you in any way, please don't hesitate to let me know.

# Reproducible workflow 

## Reproducibility checklist

::: question
What does it mean for an analysis to be reproducible?
:::

. . .

**Near term goals**:

‚úîÔ∏è Can the tables and figures be exactly reproduced from the code and data?

‚úîÔ∏è Does the code actually do what you think it does?

‚úîÔ∏è In addition to what was done, is it clear *why* it was done?

. . .

**Long term goals**:

‚úîÔ∏è Can the code be used for other data?

‚úîÔ∏è Can you extend the code to do other things?

## Why is reproducibility important?

-   Results produced are more reliable and trustworthy [@ostblom2022]

-   Facilitates more effective collaboration [@ostblom2022]

-   Contributing to science, which builds and organizes knowledge in terms of testable hypotheses [@alexander2023]

-   Possible to identify and correct errors or biases in the analysis process [@alexander2023]

## Toolkit

-   **Scriptability** $\rightarrow$ R

-   **Literate programming** (code, narrative, output in one place) $\rightarrow$ Quarto

-   **Version control** $\rightarrow$ Git / GitHub

## R and RStudio

-   R is a statistical programming language

-   RStudio is a convenient interface for R (an integrated development environment, IDE)

![Source: [Statistical Inference via Data Science](https://moderndive.com/1-getting-started.html)](images/01/r_vs_rstudio_1.png){alt="Source: Statistical Inference via Data Science" fig-align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## RStudio IDE

![](images/01/rstudio-panes.png){fig-align="center"}

## Quarto

-   Fully reproducible reports -- the analysis is run from the beginning each time you render

-   Code goes in chunks and narrative goes outside of chunks

-   Visual editor to make document editing experience similar to a word processor (Google docs, Word, Pages, etc.)

## Quarto

![](images/01/quarto.png){fig-align="center"}

## How will we use Quarto?

-   Every application exercise and assignment is written in a Quarto document

-   You'll have a template Quarto document to start with

-   The amount of scaffolding in the template will decrease over the semester

Provides a clear record of how the analysis methods evolved. This makes analysis auditable and thus more trustworthy and reliable. [@ostblom2022]

## git and GitHub

![](images/01/git-github.png){fig-align="center"}

-   **git** is a version control system -- like "Track Changes" features from Microsoft Word.
-   **GitHub** is the home for your git-based projects on the internet (like DropBox but much better).
-   There are a lot of git commands and very few people know them all. 99% of the time you will use git to add, commit, push, and pull.
