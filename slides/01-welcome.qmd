## What is regression analysis?

<div>

> *Regression analysis is a statistical method used to **examine the relationship between a response variable and one or more predictor variables.** It is used for predicting future values, understanding relationships between variables, and identifying key predictors. It also helps in modeling trends, assessing the impact of changes, and detecting outliers in data.*

# STA 210

## What is STA 210?

Learn how to use linear and and logistic regression models to analyze multivariable relationships and answer questions about real-world phenomena using a data-driven approach.

This course emphasizes application over mathematical theory.

**Pre-requisites**

100-level Statistical Science course or Statistical Science 230, 231, or 240L

. . .

::: callout-note
If you are interested in the theoretical aspects of regression and/or becoming a statistics major, STA 221 - Regression Analysis: Theory and Applications may be a better fit. Come talk with me after class!
:::

## Course learning objectives {.midi}

By the end of the semester, you will be able to...

-   analyze real-world data to answer questions about multivariable relationships.

-   use R to fit and evaluate linear and logistic regression models.

-   assess whether a proposed model is appropriate and describe its limitations.

-   implement a reproducible analysis workflow using R for analysis, Quarto to write reports and GitHub for version control and collaboration.

-   effectively communicate statistical results to a general audience.

-   assess the ethical considerations and implications of analysis decisions.

## Classroom community

::: small
It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit.

-   If you have a name that differs from those that appear in your official Duke records, please let me know.

-   Please let me know your preferred pronouns, if you are comfortable sharing.

-   If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your advisers and deans are excellent resources.

-   I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said or done in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.
:::

## Accessibility

-   The [Student Disability Access Office (SDAO)](https://access.duke.edu/students) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments.

-   If you have documented accommodations from SDAO, please send the documentation as soon as possible.

-   I am committed to making all course activities and materials accessible. If any course component is not accessible to you in any way, please don't hesitate to let me know.

## Five tips for success in STA 210

1.  Complete all the preparation work before class.

2.  Ask questions in class, office hours, and on Ed Discussion.

3.  Do the homework and labs; get started on homework early when possible.

4.  Don't procrastinate and don't let a week pass by with lingering questions.

5.  Stay up-to-date on announcements on Ed Discussion and sent via email.
