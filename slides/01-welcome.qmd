# Regression analysis

## What is regression analysis?

::: {style="font-size: 0.85em;"}
> "In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships among variables. It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when ***the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or 'predictors')***. More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or 'criterion variable') changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed."

<!--# maybe show the regression equation + matrix-->

## Course FAQ <!--# udpate this--> {.midi}

**Q - What background is assumed for the course?**

A - Introductory statistics or probability course at Duke

. . .

**Q - Will we be doing computing?**

A - Yes. We will use the computing language R for analysis, Quarto for writing up results, and GitHub for version control and collaboration

. . .

**Q - Will we learn the mathematical theory of regression?**

A - Yes and No. The course is primarily focused on application; however, we will discuss some of the mathematics of simple linear regression. There a 0.5-credit course [STA 211: Mathematics of Regression](https://stat.duke.edu/courses/mathematics-regression) to take simultaneously or after this course to dive into more of the mathematics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Course learning objectives <!--# update--> {.midi}

By the end of the semester, you will be able to...

-   analyze real-world data to answer questions about multivariable relationships.

-   use R to fit and evaluate linear and logistic regression models.

-   assess whether a proposed model is appropriate and describe its limitations.

-   use Quarto to write reproducible reports and GitHub for version control and collaboration.

-   effectively communicate statistical results through writing and oral presentations.

# Course overview

## Classroom community 

<!--# maybe restructure this-->

::: small
It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit.

-   If you have a name that differs from those that appear in your official Duke records, please let me know.

-   Please let me know your preferred pronouns, if you are comfortable sharing.

-   If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your advisers and deans are excellent resources.

-   I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said or done in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.

## Accessibility

-   The [Student Disability Access Office (SDAO)](https://access.duke.edu/students) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments.

-   If you have documented accommodations from SDAO, please send the documentation as soon as possible.

-   I am committed to making all course activities and materials accessible. If any course component is not accessible to you in any way, please don't hesitate to let me know.
