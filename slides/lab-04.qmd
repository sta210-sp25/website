# Welcome

## Goals

-   Team feedback
-   Mid-semester survey
-   Lab 04: Maximum likelihood estimation (with Palmer penguins)

## Team feedback

-   **Purpose**: To reflect on the team's collaboration and your contribution thus far

-   You should have received an email from Teammates with a link to the feedback from on October 21 around 11am

    -   Please let your TA know if you do not see the email (check your spam folder first!)

-   Team feedback is due **Thursday, October 24 at 11:59pm**

-   ***This feedback will be graded for completion only*** (go towards the Participation grade)

## Mid-semester feedback

-   **Purpose**: To give the teaching team feedback on what is working well (or not as well) in helping you learn the course content

-   The feedback is **anonymous** and will not be graded

-   It will be available until Thursday, October 24 at 11:59pm.

**We (the teaching team) appreciate you taking a few minutes to fill it out!**

## Lab 04: Maximum likelihood estimation

This lab focuses on

-   using linear regression and statistical inference to draw conclusions about penguins living in Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica.

-   exploring maximum likelihood estimators and their connection to least-squares estimators

## Reminder: Tips for working on a team

-   Do not pressure each other to finish early; use the time wisely to really learn the material and produce a quality report.

-   The labs are structured to help you learn the steps of a data analysis. Do not split up the lab among the team members; work on it together in its entirety.

-   Everyone has something to contribute! Use the lab groups as an opportunity to share ideas and learn from each other.
