## Tips for studying  {.midi}

-   Rework derivations from assignments and lecture notes

-   Review exercises in AEs and assignments, asking "why" as you review your process and reasoning

    -   e.g., Why do we include "holding all else constant" in interpretations?

-   Understand similarities and differences between linear and logistic regression

-   Focus on understanding not memorization

-   Explain concepts / process to others

-   Ask questions in office hours

-   Review lecture recordings as needed
