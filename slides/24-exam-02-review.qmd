## Tips for studying {.midi}

-   Rework derivations from assignments and lecture notes

-   Review exercises in AEs and assignments, asking "why" as you review your process and reasoning

    -   e.g., Why do we include "holding all else constant" in interpretations?

-   Understand similarities and differences between linear and logistic regression

    -   How are interpretations for logistic regression similar to interpretations for linear regression with response $\log(y)$? How are they different?

-   Focus on understanding not memorization

-   Explain concepts / process to others

-   Ask questions in office hours

-   Review lecture recordings as needed (available until December 5 at 11:45am)

-   Lecture notes and application exercises
