## Goals

-   Meet your team!
-   Team agreement
-   Lab 02: Coffee ratings

## Meet your team!

-   [**Click here**](https://prodduke-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/mt324_duke_edu/EdLwgl9diOVEvUuObtRMeX0BpuAgYmfPLaomlbZsXEBogw?e=yz2sKZ) to find your team.

-   Sit with your team.

## Team name + agreement

-   Come up with a team name. You can't have the same name as another group in the class, so be creative!

    -   Your TA will get your team name by the end of lab.

-   Fill out the team agreement. The goals of the agreement are to...

    -   Gain a common understanding of the team's goals and expectations for collaboration
    -   Make a plan for team communication
    -   Make a plan for working outside of lab

## Team workflow

-   Only <u>**one**</u> team member should type at a time. There are markers in today's lab to help you determine whose turn it is to type.

    -   Every team member should still be engaged in discussion for all questions, even if it's not your turn type.

-   Don't forget to **pull** to get your teammates' updates before making changes to the `.qmd` file.

    ::: callout-important
    **Only one submission per team on Gradescope. Read the submission instructions carefully!**
    :::

## Team workflow, in action

-   Complete the "Workflow: Using Git and GitHub as a team" section of the lab in your teams.
-   Raise your hand if you have any questions about the workflow.

```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown::countdown(minutes = 5, font_size = "2em")
```

## Tips for working on a team {.midi}

-   Do not pressure each other to finish early; use the time wisely to really learn the material and produce a quality report.

-   The labs are structured to help you learn the steps of a data analysis. Do not split up the lab among the team members; work on it together in its entirety.

-   Everyone has something to contribute! Use the lab groups as an opportunity to share ideas and learn from each other.

## Today's lab 

Today's lab focuses on using statistical inference based on mathematical models to explore the relationship between coffee's properties and the overall quality rating.
