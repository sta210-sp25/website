## Topics

-   Multicollinearity

    -   Recap

    -   What to do about it

## Data: Trail users {.midi}

-   The Pioneer Valley Planning Commission (PVPC) collected data at the beginning a trail in Florence, MA for ninety days from April 5, 2005 to November 15, 2005
-   Data collectors set up a laser sensor, with breaks in the laser beam recording when a rail-trail user passed the data collection station.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

rail_trail <- read_csv(here::here("slides", "data/rail_trail.csv"))
rail_trail |> slice(1:5)
```

## Variables

**Outcome**:

-   `volume` estimated number of trail users that day (number of breaks recorded)

**Predictors**

-   `hightemp` daily high temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit)

-   `avgtemp` average of daily low and daily high temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit)

-   `season` one of “Fall”, “Spring”, or “Summer”

-   `precip` measure of precipitation (in inches)

## EDA: Relationship between predictors {.midi}

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center

rail_trail |>
  select(hightemp, avgtemp, season, precip) |>
  ggpairs()
```

## Multicollinearity {.midi}

-   **Multicollinearity**: near-linear dependence among predictors

-   The **variance inflation factor (VIF)** measures how much the linear dependencies impact the variance of the predictors

$$
VIF_{j} = \frac{1}{1 - R^2_j}
$$

where $R^2_j$ is the proportion of variation in $x_j$ that is explained by all the other predictors

-   Thresholds:

    -   VIF \> 10: concerning multicollinearity

    -   VIF \> 5: potentially worth further investigationApplication exercise

## How multicollinearity impacts model {.midi}

::: incremental
-   When we have perfect collinearities, we are unable to get estimates for the coefficients

-   When we have almost perfect collinearities (i.e. highly correlated predictor variables), the standard errors for our regression coefficients inflate

    -   In other words, we lose precision in our estimates of the regression coefficients

    -   This impedes our ability to use the model for inference

-   It is also difficult to interpret the model coefficients
:::

## Dealing with multicollinearity

::: incremental
-   Collect more data (often not feasible given practical constraints)

-   Redefine the correlated predictors to keep the information from predictors but eliminate collinearity

    -   e.g., if $x_1, x_2, x_3$ are correlated, use a new variable $(x_1 + x_2) / x_3$ in the model

-   For categorical predictors, avoid using levels with very few observations as the baseline

-   Remove one of the correlated variables

    -   Be careful about substantially reducing predictive power of the model
