    -   Introduce subject matter and research question

    -   Highlights from exploratory data analysis

    -   Modeling strategy / initial modeling (if available)

    -   Any questions you'd like to get feedback on

See [project instructions](https://sta221-fa24.netlify.app/project#presentation) for more detail.

## Lab 05: Expanding multiple linear regression

This lab focuses on

-   modeling complex data using variable transformations, categorical predictors and interactions, and various model specifications.

-   evaluating model diagnostics and conditions.

## Reminder: Tips for working on a team

-   Do not pressure each other to finish early; use the time wisely to really learn the material and produce a quality report.

-   The labs are structured to help you learn the steps of a data analysis. Do not split up the lab among the team members; work on it together in its entirety.

-   Everyone has something to contribute! Use the lab groups as an opportunity to share ideas and learn from each other.
