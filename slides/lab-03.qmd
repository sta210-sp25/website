-   **Goal**: Use the methods from STA 210 to analyze data and answer a research question developed by your team

-   **Primary deliverables:**

    1.  an in-person presentation about the exploratory data analysis and initial modeling

    2.  a written, reproducible final report detailing your analysis

    3.  a summary of your project highlights to share with the class

    4.  a GitHub repository containing all work from the project

-   There are periodic project milestones throughout the semester to help you work towards the primary deliverables

## Todayâ€™s focus: Research topics

-   **Goals:** Identify three potential research topics your team is interested in investigating and draft research questions.

-   You do [**not**]{.underline} need to have a data set at this point

-   You can discuss the topics you put in the student survey to help generate ideas

-   **Submission (due Feb 16)**: All work for the project will be submitted in your teamâ€™s GitHub repo. You will receive feedback via an Issue on GitHub to model a workflow often used in practice.
