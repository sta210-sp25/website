## Data: Houses in Duke Forest

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Data on houses that were sold in the Duke Forest neighborhood of Durham, NC around November 2020
-   Scraped from Zillow
-   Source: [`openintro::duke_forest`](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/duke_forest.html)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Goal**: Use the area (in square feet) to understand variability in the price of houses in Duke Forest.

```{r}
#| include: false


duke_forest_fit <- lm(price ~ area, data = duke_forest)
duke_forest_aug <- augment(duke_forest_fit)
```

## Clone repo + Start new RStudio project {.midi}

-   Go to the course organization. Click on the repo with the prefix `ae-01`. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the AE.

-   Click on the green **CODE** button, select **Use SSH** (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, youâ€™ll see the text **Clone with SSH**). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

-   In RStudio, go to *File* â†’ *New Project* â†’ *Version Control* â†’ *Git*.

-   Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box *Repository URL*.

-   Click *Create Project*, and the files from your GitHub repo will be displayed in the *Files* pane in RStudio.

-   Click `ae-01.qmd` to open the template Quarto file. This is where you will write up your code and narrative for the AE.

# Model assessment

We fit a model but is it any good?

## Two statistics

-   **Root mean square error, RMSE**: A measure of the average error (average difference between observed and predicted values of the outcome)

-   **R-squared**, $R^2$ : Percentage of variability in the outcome explained by the regression model (in the context of SLR, the predictor)

. . .

::: question
What indicates a good model fit? Higher or lower RMSE? Higher or lower $R^2$?
:::

## RMSE

$$
RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^ne_i^2}{n}}
$$

. . .

::: incremental
-   Ranges between 0 (perfect predictor) and infinity (terrible predictor)

-   Same units as the response variable

-   The value of RMSE is more useful for comparing across models than evaluating a single model (more on this when we get to regression with multiple predictors)

# ANOVA and $R^2$

## ANOVA {#analysis-of-variance-anova}

**Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)**: Technique to partition variability in $Y$ by the sources of variability

<br>

![](images/clipboard-3964457409.png)

## Total variability (Response)

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 10

ggplot(data = duke_forest, aes(x = price)) +
   geom_histogram(fill = "#407E99", color = "black") + 
  labs(x = "Price (in US Dollars)") + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_dollar(scale_cut = cut_long_scale()))

```

```{r}
#| echo: false

duke_forest |>
  summarise(Min = min(price), Median = median(price), Max = max(price), Mean = mean(price), Std.Dev = sd(price)) |>
  kable(digits =3)

```

## Partition sources of variability in `price`

```{r}
#| echo: false
mean_y <- mean(duke_forest$price)

ggplot(data = duke_forest, aes(x = area, y = price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean_y, color = "#407E99") +
  labs(x = "Area (in sqft)",
       y = "Price (in USD)") +
  annotate("text", x = 6000, y = 500000, label = latex2exp::TeX("$\\bar{y}$"), color = "#407E99", size = 6) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar(scale_cut = cut_long_scale()))
```

## Total variability (Response)

```{r}
#| echo: false
mean_y <- mean(duke_forest$price)

ggplot(data = duke_forest, aes(x = area, y = price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean_y, color = "#407E99") +
  geom_segment(aes(x=area, xend=area, y=price, yend=mean_y), color = "#407E99", size = 1) + 
  labs(x = "Area (in sqft)",
       y = "Price (in USD)") +
  annotate("text", x = 6000, y = 475000, label = latex2exp::TeX("$\\bar{y}$"), color = "#407E99", size = 6) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar(scale_cut = cut_long_scale()))
```

$$\text{Sum of Squares Total (SST)} = \sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \bar{y})^2 = (n-1)s_y^2$$

## Explained variability (Model)

```{r}
#| echo: false
mean_y <- mean(duke_forest$price)

ggplot(data = duke_forest, aes(x = area, y = price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean_y, color = "#407E99") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "#993399") +
  geom_segment(aes(x=area, xend=area, y=mean_y, yend=predict(duke_forest_fit)), color = "#993399", size = 1) + 
  labs(x = "Area (in sqft)",
       y = "Price (in USD)") +
  annotate("text", x = 6000, y = 475000, label = latex2exp::TeX("$\\bar{y}$"), color = "#407E99", size = 6) + 
  annotate("text", x = 6000, y = 1200000, label = latex2exp::TeX("$\\hat{\\mu}_y$"), color = "#993399", size = 6) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar(scale_cut = cut_long_scale()))
```

$$\text{Sum of Squares Model (SSM)} = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}(\hat{y}_i - \bar{y})^2$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Unexplained variability (Residuals)

```{r}
#| echo: false
mean_y <- mean(duke_forest$price)

ggplot(data = duke_forest, aes(x = area, y = price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean_y, color = "#407E99") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "#993399") +
  geom_segment(aes(x=area, xend=area, y = price, yend=predict(duke_forest_fit)), color = "#8BB174") + 
  labs(x = "Area (in sqft)",
       y = "Price (in USD)") +
  annotate("text", x = 6000, y = 475000, label = latex2exp::TeX("$\\bar{y}$"), color = "#407E99", size = 6) + 
  annotate("text", x = 6000, y = 1200000, label = latex2exp::TeX("$\\hat{\\mu}_y$"), color = "#993399", size = 6) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar(scale_cut = cut_long_scale()))
```

$$\text{Sum of Squares Residuals (SSR)} = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$$

## Sum of Squares

<br>

$$
\begin{aligned}
\color{#407E99}{SST} \hspace{5mm}&= &\color{#993399}{SSM} &\hspace{5mm} +  &\color{#8BB174}{SSR} \\[10pt]
\color{#407E99}{\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \bar{y})^2} \hspace{5mm}&= &\color{#993399}{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(\hat{y}_i - \bar{y})^2} &\hspace{5mm}+ &\color{#8BB174}{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

## $R^2$

The **coefficient of determination** $R^2$ is the proportion of variation in the response, $Y$, that is explained by the regression model

<br>

$$\large{R^2 = \frac{SSM}{SST} = 1 - \frac{SSR}{SST}}$$

<br>

::: question
What is the range of $R^2$? Does $R^2$ have units?
:::

## Interpreting \$R\^2\$ {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: false

df_fit_rsq <- round(glance(duke_forest_fit)$r.squared, 3) * 100

```

::: panel-tabset
## Question

::: appex
Submit your response to the following question on Ed Discussion.

::: midi
The $R^2$ of the model for price from area of houses in Duke Forest is `r df_fit_rsq`%. Which of the following is the correct interpretation of this value?

1.  Area correctly predicts `r df_fit_rsq`% of price for houses in Duke Forest.
2.  `r df_fit_rsq`% of the variability in price for houses in Duke Forest can be explained by area.
3.  `r df_fit_rsq`% of the variability in area for houses in Duke Forest can be explained by price.
4.  `r df_fit_rsq`% of the time price for houses in Duke Forest can be predicted by area.

Do you think this model is useful for explaining variability in the price of Duke Forest houses?

# Using R

## Augmented data frame

Use the `augment()` function from the **broom** package to add columns for predicted values, residuals, and other observation-level model statistics

. . .

```{r}
duke_forest_aug <- augment(duke_forest_fit)
duke_forest_aug
```

## Finding RMSE in R

Use the `rmse()` function from the **yardstick** package (part of **tidymodels**)

```{r}
#| echo: true
rmse(duke_forest_aug, truth = price, estimate = .fitted)
```

<br>

::: question
Do you think this model is useful for predicting the price of Duke Forest houses?
:::

## Finding $R^2$ in R

Use the `rsq()` function from the **yardstick** package (part of **tidymodels**)

```{r}
#| echo: true
rsq(duke_forest_aug, truth = price, estimate = .fitted)
```

<br>

. . .

Alternatively, use `glance()` to construct a single row summary of the model fit, including $R^2$:

```{r}
#| echo: true

glance(duke_forest_fit)$r.squared
```

## Recap

-   Used R to conduct exploratory data analysis and fit a model

-   Evaluated models using RMSE and $R^2$

-   Used analysis of variance to partition variability in the response variable
